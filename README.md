A pokemon wiki application that provides information about the world of pokemon such as characters, evolution and they food, also in this application comparisons between characters with one another

### ðŸŽ¯Point

From this project I can performe how to fecth a pokemon data from [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) and considering the api quite complicated for me because every data branch especially with evolution on each character, Also in this project I learn how to use animation and transition from moving to another page.
